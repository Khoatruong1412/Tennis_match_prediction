# Tennis_match_prediction
- This respitory is dedicated to predicting the winner of a tennis match.
- Use 4 different machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Nayes, QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis, RidgeClassifier.
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.

# Preparation of data.
- I only picked matches that are completed.
- The original dataset

- I create a new feature called winning rate, which is the probability of winning of a player based on a serie and court environment. Then, I prepare the dataset so that it is ready for analysis and machine learning.
- Features: Players' ranking points, the winning rate, serie, and environment.
- Target: Winner of the match.
