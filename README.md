# Tennis_match_prediction
- This respitory is dedicated to predicting the winner of a tennis match.
- Use 4 different machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Nayes, QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis, RidgeClassifier.
- Metric: We only used accuracy since we just want to predict the winners.

## Preparation of data
- I only picked matches that are completed.
- The original dataset

- I create a new feature called winning rate, which is the probability of winning of a player based on a serie and court environment. Then, I prepare the dataset so that it is ready for analysis and machine learning.
- Apply permutation for randomization of targets while keeping it accurate.
- Features: Players' ranking points, their winning rates, serie, and environment.
- Target: Winner of the match.

## Data analysis
#### Yearly Difference of ranking points
- Difference = Winner's point - Loser's point.
- The higher the difference, the better the model.

- Most of the time, the difference is high. However, around 25% of the players that win matches with less points.

- High standard deviation due to outliers.

- Based on the graph, even though the result is not great, logistic regression has the best performance. Accuracy is around 61% to 64%.
 
## Challenge
- There are not enough features such as players' injuries, playstyles, etc. that can affect the result of the match.

# How to re-create the result
- Download data from http://www.tennis-data.co.uk/
- The dataset is too big so I can't upload to github. However, all of the data are on this website and they are free!
- Use the python script called 'Tennis_Matches_ML' to clean, analyze, and generate the final result.

#### Packages:
- All of the usual packages: sklearn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
